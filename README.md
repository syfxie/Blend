After admiring the works of Van Gogh and da Vinci at the museum, it is now your turn to pick up the paintbrush! Except, of course, most of us can barely draw an apple...

Introducting Blend!, a personal gallery where you can create masterpieces and transform photos from your album into paint-like pieces. Hours of sketching and painting are replaced by a few clicks of the mouse: choose a photo, and choose a photo whose "style" you want your work to be displayed in, and you're all set!

## Features
- **Image Synthesis:** Users can combine photos with another reference artwork/photo to alter the "texture" of the original photo based on the style of the reference.
- **Personal Art Gallery:** Images that users create can be saved to their galleries, and they can come back to admire their work anytime.

## More Features Coming Soon!
